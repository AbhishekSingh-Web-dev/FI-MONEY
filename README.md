Product Management: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for inventory products.

API Documentation: Interactive API documentation powered by Swagger.

Containerized: Ready to run with Docker for a consistent and isolated environment.

üíª Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose)

Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose

üöÄ Running with Docker (Recommended)
This is the simplest way to get the entire application up and running with a single command.

1. Prerequisites
Docker Desktop must be installed and running on your system.

2. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/AbhishekSingh-Web-dev/FI-MONEY.git
cd FI-MONEY

3. Create Environment File
The application requires a single .env file in the root of the project to store backend credentials.

Create a new file named .env.

Copy the contents from the example below and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

Example .env content:

# Backend Environment Variables
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_and_long_jwt_key

4. Build and Run!
Execute the following command from the root directory:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build

Once the build is complete, the application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

To stop the application, press Ctrl + C in the terminal, and then run docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down.

üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Setup (Manual)
Follow these steps if you prefer to run the services manually without Docker.

Backend Setup
Navigate to the directory:

cd backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Create .env file:
Create a .env file inside the backend folder and add your credentials (see example in the Docker section).

Start the server:

npm run dev

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the directory (in a new terminal):

cd frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Create .env file:
Create a .env file inside the frontend folder with the following content:

VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

Start the client:

npm run dev
